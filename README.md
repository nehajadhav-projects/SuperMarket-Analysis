# SuperMarket Analysis (Interactive Dashboard Creation On MS-Excel)

## Project Description
This project involves analyzing the sales and cost of goods sold (COGS) data of a supermarket chain to identify trends, optimize performance, and provide actionable insights. The analysis spans branch-wise, city-wise, product-line-wise, and payment-type-wise performance, offering a holistic view of the supermarket's operations.

## Project Objectives
1.	Analyze branch-wise and city-wise sales and COGS to identify top-performing locations.
2.	Evaluate product-line performance to determine profitable categories and opportunities for improvement.
3.	Assess customer preferences based on payment methods (cash, credit card, e-wallet).
4.	Explore monthly trends in sales and COGS to detect seasonality and predict future performance.
5.	Understand the relationship between ratings, customer types (members vs. normal), and sales.

## Key Insights
1.	Branch-wise and City-wise Analysis:
-	The Giza branch had the highest sales (110,569), outperforming Alex (106,202) and Cairo (106,199).
-	Among cities, Naypyitaw recorded the highest sales and gross margin, indicating a strong market presence.
2.	Product-Line Performance:
-	The Food and Beverages product line achieved the highest sales (56,153) but also incurred high COGS (53,480), suggesting it drives revenue but may have lower margins.
-	Health and Beauty had lower sales (49,190) and COGS (46,854), potentially indicating an underperforming category.
3.	Payment-Type Preferences:
-	Cash transactions led with the highest sales (112,202) compared to credit card (100,772) and e-wallet (109,996).
-	Cash also contributed the highest gross margin, making it the most profitable payment method.
4.	Monthly Trends:
-	Sales and COGS were highest in January and significantly declined from April onwards, indicating potential seasonality in customer demand.
5.	Customer Segmentation:
- Male and female customers are evenly distributed, implying no significant gender-based sales bias.
-	Members likely contribute more consistently to sales across branches, though this requires further analysis to quantify.

## Recommendations
1.	Branch Optimization:
-	Focus on expanding operations or marketing efforts in Giza and Naypyitaw to capitalize on their strong performance.
-	Investigate factors limiting sales in Alex and Cairo to implement targeted improvements.

-	Increase promotional efforts for underperforming categories like Health and Beauty to boost sales.
3.	Payment Methods:
-	Encourage cash transactions by offering discounts or loyalty points, as they provide the highest gross margin.
-	Explore strategies to increase e-wallet usage, as it is competitive with cash in sales volume.
4.	Seasonal Planning:
-	Focus on targeted promotions or inventory optimization during low-sales months (April onwards).
-	Increase stock and marketing budgets for January and Q1, as these months show peak sales.
5.	Customer Engagement:
